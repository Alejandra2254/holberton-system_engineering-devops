Configuration management (CM) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life

## Puppet

Puppet is a tool designed to declaratively manage the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows-like systems. The user describes the system resources and their states using the declarative language provided by Puppet. This information is stored in files called Puppet manifests. Puppet discovers system information through a utility called Facter, and compiles the manifests into a system-specific catalog that contains the resources and dependencies on those resources. These catalogs are run on the target systems.
