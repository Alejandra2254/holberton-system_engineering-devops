*Permissions
IS a method that have to be devised to protect the users from each other. After all, we wouldn't want the actions of one user to crash the computer, nor would we allos one user to interfere with the files belonging to another user.

Chmod
This command is used to change the permissions of a file or diretory. There is two ways to specify the permissions. We are gonna use the OCtal notation method.The chmod command can also be used to control the access permissions for the directories.
-Thinking that the permission settings are as a series of bits.
-We represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner,group and other) as a single digit.
-We have a table of numbers that covers all the common settings.
